# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction using Prophet
Just wrapped up a new project: **Microsoft Stock Price Prediction using Prophet** ðŸ“ˆ

What I did:
- Built two forecasting models (log-transformed & raw)
- Engineered lag features for temporal dependencies
- Integrated Indian holiday calendar to capture market seasonality
- Evaluated performance using MAPE & RMSE
- Ran fast cross-validation to validate robustness

Why it matters:
Accurate stock forecasting empowers smarter investment decisions and helps identify market trends early.
This project leverages Facebook Prophet to forecast Microsoft stock prices with enhanced accuracy using log transformation, lag features, and Indian holiday effects.

##  Key Features
- Time series forecasting with Prophet
- Log-transformed and raw model comparison

- Indian holiday calendar integration
- Outlier capping for robust predictions
- Fast cross-validation with performance metrics

##  Evaluation Metrics
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

##  Results
- Forecasts generated for both log-transformed and raw models
- Cross-validation summary with MAPE and RMSE
